# Fitness-Tracker

## Description
This repository contains my workout tracker. The project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve University's Coding Bootcamp. It required me to create a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
